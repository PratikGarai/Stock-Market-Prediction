# Stock-Market-Prediction

Warning : This was just an approximate forecast based on past events and more of a practise using RNN. 
The fundamental flaw with this approach is that this approach takes into the consideration the past data. 
However, real stocks isn't governed by past stock value numbers, it is goverened by other events such as performance of company, confidence of investors, etc.
As that data isn't in the dataset, the predictions aren't correct either.
